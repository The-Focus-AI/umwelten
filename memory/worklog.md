- **Multi-step tool calling** support with `maxSteps` configuration
- **Proper error handling** with tool-specific error types (`ToolExecutionError`, `ToolValidationError`, `ToolNotFoundError`)
- **Tool execution context** with abort signals, messages, and metadata

#### ✅ Example Tools Implementation
- **Calculator tool**: Basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- **Random number generator**: Configurable range and integer/decimal output
- **Statistics tool**: Mean, median, mode, standard deviation calculations
- **Proper categorization** and tagging system for tool discovery

#### ✅ Integration with Existing Architecture

- **`tools list`**: Display all registered tools with metadata
- **`tools demo`**: Interactive demonstration of tool calling capabilities
- **Comprehensive tool execution summary** with cost, tokens, and timing

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Tool Definition Pattern
```typescript
const tool: ToolDefinition<ZodSchema> = {
  name: "toolName",
  description: "Tool description",
  parameters: zodSchema,
  execute: async (args, context) => ({ result, metadata }),
  metadata: { category, tags, version }
};
```

#### Integration Pattern
```typescript
interaction.setTools(toolSet);
interaction.setMaxSteps(5);
const response = await runner.streamText(interaction);
```

### Validation Results

- ✅ **Tool Registration**: Tools properly registered and discoverable
- ✅ **CLI Commands**: `tools list` and `tools demo` functional
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper error handling
- ✅ **Architecture Alignment**: Tools as part of stimulus context (Umwelt concept)

### Next Steps for Phase 2.2
1. **MCP Integration**: Implement Model Context Protocol client and server
2. **Tool Interoperability**: Enable tools to work with both Vercel AI SDK and MCP
3. **Advanced Tool Features**: Tool composition, conditional execution
4. **Performance Optimization**: Tool caching and parallel execution

### Key Decisions Made
- **Unified Tool Interface**: Single definition works with multiple frameworks
- **Type-First Approach**: Leveraging Zod for runtime validation and TypeScript inference
- **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation between tool definition, registration, and execution
- **Semantic Alignment**: Tools as stimulus components in the Umwelt framework

The implementation successfully bridges the gap between our semantic "Umwelt" architecture and modern AI SDK patterns, providing a solid foundation for advanced tool capabilities and MCP integration.
