The implementation maintains the project's strong architectural foundation while enabling rich integration with the broader MCP ecosystem.

## Current Focus: The Great Renaming & MCP Integration

### Overview
Executing a comprehensive architectural refactoring to align the codebase with the "Umwelt" concept - creating a more cohesive semantic framework around how models perceive and interact with their environment. This includes integrating Model-Context-Protocol (MCP) support.

### Philosophical Foundation
The renaming reflects a shift from generic terms to semantically meaningful concepts:
- **Cognition**: The reasoning and thinking processes (formerly "models")
- **Interaction**: Model-environment interactions (formerly "conversation") 
- **Stimulus**: Input that triggers cognitive response (formerly "prompt")
- **Umwelt**: The perceptual world model operates within

### Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Semantic Renaming
1. **Directory Structure Changes**
   - `src/models` â†’ `src/cognition`
   - `src/conversation` â†’ `src/interaction`

2. **File and Class Renaming**
   - `conversation.ts` â†’ `interaction.ts`
   - `Conversation` class â†’ `Interaction`
   - `prompt.ts` â†’ `stimulus.ts` 
   - `Prompt` class â†’ `Stimulus`

3. **Import Path Updates**
   - Update all import statements across the codebase
   - Maintain backward compatibility where possible
   - Update test files accordingly

#### Phase 2: MCP Integration
1. **Create MCP Infrastructure**
   - `src/mcp/client.ts` - MCP client for consuming external tools
   - `src/mcp/server.ts` - MCP server for exposing our tools
   - `src/mcp/types.ts` - MCP protocol types and interfaces

2. **Tool Organization**
   - Create `src/stimulus/tools/` directory
   - Move existing tool definitions
   - Structure tools for MCP compatibility

#### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
1. **Test Suite Updates**
   - Update all test files for new names/paths
   - Ensure all 25+ tests continue passing
   - Add MCP integration tests

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update README and documentation
   - Update memory files
   - Create MCP usage guides

### Current Status
- [X] Memory files reviewed and understood
- [X] Implementation plan created

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Incremental Approach**: Execute changes in phases to maintain stability
2. **Test Coverage**: Run full test suite after each phase
3. **Backup Strategy**: Ensure git commits at each major step
4. **Rollback Plan**: Clear path to revert if issues arise

### Success Criteria
1. All existing functionality preserved
2. All tests continue passing
3. Improved semantic clarity in codebase
4. MCP integration functional

This refactoring represents a significant evolution in the project's conceptual framework while maintaining its solid technical foundation.

## Current Focus
Designing evaluation strategies for model responses, incorporating both deterministic (unit test style) and AI-assisted evaluation approaches.

## Evaluation Strategy Types

### 1. Deterministic Evaluations
These are unit-test style evaluations with clear pass/fail criteria:

1. Schema Validation
   - Zod schema conformance
   - Required field presence
   - Data type correctness
   - Field format validation

2. Content Structure Tests
   - Array length requirements
   - Object property presence
   - Numerical range validation
   - String pattern matching

3. Factual Accuracy Tests
   - Known value matching
   - Date/time accuracy
   - URL validity
   - Numerical precision

4. Format Compliance
   - JSON structure
   - Markdown formatting
   - HTML validity
   - Code syntax checking

### 2. AI-Assisted Evaluations
Using evaluation models to assess qualitative aspects:

1. Content Quality Assessment
   ```typescript
   interface QualityMetrics {
     relevance: number;      // 0-10 scale
     completeness: number;   // 0-10 scale
     accuracy: number;       // 0-10 scale
     coherence: number;      // 0-10 scale
     reasoning: number;      // 0-10 scale
   }
   ```

2. Response Comparison
   - Compare multiple model outputs
   - Identify unique insights
   - Assess reasoning paths
   - Evaluate completeness

3. Creative/Subjective Tasks
   - Writing style analysis
   - Code quality review
   - Design suggestion evaluation
   - Problem-solving approach

### Implementation Plan

1. Evaluation Interface
```typescript
interface ResponseEvaluation {
  // Deterministic checks
  schemaValidation: {
    passed: boolean;
    errors?: string[];
  };
  contentChecks: {
    passed: boolean;
    results: Record<string, boolean>;
  };
  
  // AI-assisted evaluation
  qualityMetrics?: QualityMetrics;
  comparisonResults?: ComparisonAnalysis;
  
  // Overall scores
  scores: {
    technical: number;    // 0-100, based on deterministic checks
    qualitative: number;  // 0-100, based on AI evaluation
    overall: number;      // Weighted combination
  };
}
```

2. Evaluation Configuration
```typescript
interface EvaluationConfig {
  // Deterministic checks
  schema?: z.ZodSchema;
  contentChecks?: {
    name: string;
    check: (response: any) => boolean;
  }[];
  
  // AI evaluation settings
  useAiEvaluation?: boolean;
  evaluationPrompt?: string;
  evaluationModel?: ModelDetails;
  
  // Scoring weights
  weights?: {
    technical: number;
    qualitative: number;
  };
}
```

3. Result Storage
```typescript
interface EvaluationResult {
  metadata: {
    testId: string;
    modelDetails: ModelDetails;
    timestamp: string;
    config: EvaluationConfig;
  };
  evaluation: ResponseEvaluation;
  rawResponse: any;
  processingMetrics: {
    responseTime: number;
    tokenUsage: TokenUsage;
    cost: number;
  };
}
```

    date: z.string().datetime(),
    author: z.string(),
    topics: z.array(z.string())
  }),
  contentChecks: [
    {
      name: "hasValidTitle",
      check: (r) => r.title.length > 0 && r.title.length < 200
    }
  ]
};
```

2. Creative Writing Evaluation
```typescript
const config: EvaluationConfig = {
  useAiEvaluation: true,
  evaluationPrompt: `
    Evaluate this creative writing response on:
    1. Originality (0-10)
    2. Narrative structure (0-10)
    3. Character development (0-10)
    4. Language use (0-10)
    5. Overall impact (0-10)
  `,
  weights: {
    technical: 0.2,   // Basic formatting, grammar
    qualitative: 0.8  // AI evaluation score
  }
};
```

## Next Steps

Each implementation demonstrates the framework's flexibility while maintaining consistent patterns for:
- Data caching
- Result storage
- Model evaluation
- Error handling

The framework is now stable and ready for additional implementations and enhancements.

## 2025-06-18: LM Studio Provider Integration Complete
- LM Studio provider implemented using REST API
- Registered in model registry and CLI
- Tests use first loaded model for text generation
- Error handling for invalid model IDs is robust
- All provider tests pass

### Next Steps
- Consider adding modality support (text, vision, etc.)
- Further enhancements as needed 

## Overview
- Recent test run using `dotenvx run -- pnpm test:run` resulted in multiple failures across model listing, Ollama, and OpenRouter provider tests.

## Current Focus
- Diagnose and repair failing tests, starting with model registry/expectation mismatches, Ollama model availability, and OpenRouter authentication/model ID issues.

## Main Issues
- Model listing/filtering tests expect a small, fixed set of models, but actual output contains hundreds.
- Ollama provider tests fail due to missing model `gemma3:latest`.
- OpenRouter provider tests fail due to invalid model IDs or authentication issues.

## Next Steps
1. Categorize and prioritize test failures.
2. Fix Ollama model issue (pull or update model in tests).
3. Update OpenRouter API key/model IDs as needed.
4. Update model listing/filtering test expectations.
5. Document progress and lessons learned.

## Blockers
- None at this stage, pending investigation of model availability and API credentials.

## Decisions
- Proceeding with test repair in prioritized order.
