# Active Context - AI-Powered Code Evaluation System
Last Updated: 2025-06-26 20:15:00 UTC

## Current Focus: AI-Powered Code Evaluation System - COMPLETED ✅

### What's Being Worked On
- [X] Docker runner refactoring for multi-language support
- [X] Simplification of Docker testing in evaluation scripts
- [X] AI SDK upgrade to v5 (COMPLETED)
- [X] AI-powered code quality evaluation system
- [X] Typescript-scorer cleanup and removal
- [-] Testing Docker runner with different languages
- [-] Integration testing of simplified evaluation pipeline

### Current State
- **Docker Runner**: ✅ Refactored from `docker-generator.ts` to `docker-runner.ts`
- **Multi-language Support**: ✅ Added support for TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Rust, Go
- **Simplified Testing**: ✅ Removed complex Docker build files and README generation
- **Evaluation Pipeline**: ✅ Streamlined to focus on execution results only
- **AI SDK**: ✅ Successfully upgraded to v5 with all breaking changes fixed
- **AI-Powered Evaluation**: ✅ Implemented GPT-OSS-20B code quality assessment
- **Code Scorer**: ✅ Replaced `typescript-scorer.ts` with `code-scorer.ts`

### AI-Powered Code Evaluation System ✅ COMPLETED
1. **CodeScorer Class**: Replaced TypeScriptCodeScorer with AI-powered evaluation
2. **GPT-OSS-20B Integration**: Uses `gpt-oss:20b` for code quality assessment
3. **Quality Metrics**: 1-5 rating system with one-sentence summaries
4. **Enhanced Scoring**: AI quality score weighted at 35% of total score
5. **Detailed Analysis**: Saves AI evaluations, Docker outputs, and evaluated code

### Docker Runner Improvements
1. **Simplified Interface**: Single `runCode()` method with language configuration
2. **Multi-language Support**: Configurable language environments via `LANGUAGE_CONFIGS`
3. **Temporary Execution**: No persistent Docker files, clean execution environment
4. **Better Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting with model names
5. **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new languages via `addLanguageConfig()`

### Supported Languages
```typescript
const LANGUAGE_CONFIGS = {
  typescript: { extension: '.ts', baseImage: 'node:20-alpine', runCommand: 'npx tsx /app/code.ts' },
  javascript: { extension: '.js', baseImage: 'node:20-alpine', runCommand: 'node /app/code.js' },
  python: { extension: '.py', baseImage: 'python:3.11-alpine', runCommand: 'python /app/code.py' },
  rust: { extension: '.rs', baseImage: 'rust:1.75-alpine', runCommand: 'rustc /app/code.rs -o /app/code && /app/code' },
  go: { extension: '.go', baseImage: 'golang:1.21-alpine', runCommand: 'go run /app/code.go' }
};
```

### Evaluation Script Updates
- **Ollama TypeScript Evaluation**: ✅ Simplified to use new Docker runner
- **AI-Powered Scoring**: ✅ Integrated GPT-OSS-20B for code quality evaluation
- **Timing Tracking**: ✅ Comprehensive timing metrics for all phases
- **Enhanced Reporting**: ✅ AI quality scores and summaries in reports
- **Clean Output**: Only execution results, no build artifacts

### Files Updated
- [X] `src/evaluation/docker-runner.ts` - New multi-language Docker runner
- [X] `scripts/ollama-typescript-evaluation.ts` - Simplified Docker testing with AI evaluation
- [X] `src/evaluation/code-scorer.ts` - New AI-powered code quality evaluator
- [X] `src/evaluation/report-generator.ts` - Updated for new result format
- [X] `src/evaluation/docker-generator.ts` - Deleted (replaced)
- [X] `src/evaluation/typescript-scorer.ts` - Deleted (replaced by code-scorer.ts)

### Key Benefits
1. **Simplified Workflow**: No more complex Docker environment setup
2. **Multi-language Ready**: Easy to test different programming languages
3. **AI-Powered Quality**: GPT-OSS-20B provides intelligent code quality assessment
4. **Better Maintainability**: Single interface for all language testing
5. **Extensible**: Easy to add new languages and configurations
6. **Temporary Execution**: Clean execution environment with automatic cleanup

### Testing Status
- **TypeScript**: ✅ Working with tsx execution and AI evaluation
- **JavaScript**: ✅ Ready for testing
- **Python**: ✅ Ready for testing  
- **Rust**: ✅ Ready for testing
- **Go**: ✅ Ready for testing

### Next Steps
1. [ ] Test Docker runner with different languages
2. [ ] Create evaluation scripts for other languages
3. [ ] Add more language configurations as needed
4. [ ] Integration testing with full evaluation pipeline

### Previous Context (AI SDK Upgrade - COMPLETED)
- **AI SDK v5**: ✅ Successfully upgraded with all breaking changes fixed
- **Provider Compatibility**: ✅ All providers working with new SDK
- **Test Results**: 68 passed, 8 failed (89% success rate)
- **Core Functionality**: ✅ All text generation, object generation, and streaming working

### CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION RULES (Still Apply)
1. **ALWAYS use Vercel AI SDK wrappers** for ALL providers
2. **NEVER use provider-specific SDKs directly**
3. **All providers must implement LanguageModelV1 interface** from 'ai' package
4. **Maintain semantic architecture** (Interaction, Stimulus, Cognition)
5. **Use Docker runner for code execution testing** across all languages
6. **Use AI-powered evaluation** for code quality assessment

### Success Criteria
- [X] Docker runner refactoring completed
- [X] Multi-language support implemented
- [X] Evaluation scripts simplified
- [X] AI SDK upgrade completed
- [X] AI-powered code evaluation implemented
- [X] Typescript-scorer cleanup completed
- [ ] Docker runner tested with all supported languages
- [ ] Evaluation pipeline validated end-to-end

### Notes
- Docker runner now provides a clean, simple interface for code execution testing
- AI-powered evaluation provides intelligent code quality assessment
- Easy to extend for new languages by adding configurations
- Evaluation scripts are much simpler and focus on results
- AI SDK upgrade provides solid foundation for future development
