## Notes

### Migration Challenges
- **Complex Dependencies**: Some scripts have complex dependencies that need careful handling
- **Caching Integration**: Ensuring all scripts benefit from caching improvements
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintaining compatibility during migration
- **Testing**: Ensuring all migrated scripts work correctly

### Migration Priorities
1. **High Priority**: Simple scripts that are easy to migrate
2. **Medium Priority**: Complex scripts that provide significant value
3. **Low Priority**: Scripts that are rarely used or experimental

### Migration Strategy
- **Incremental**: Migrate one script at a time
- **Testing**: Test each migration thoroughly
- **Documentation**: Document each migration step
- **Rollback**: Maintain ability to rollback if needed

## Next Steps

1. **Begin Phase 1**: Start implementing foundation infrastructure
2. **Track Progress**: Update this document as migration progresses
3. **Test Early**: Test each component as it's implemented
4. **Gather Feedback**: Get feedback on implementation approach
5. **Iterate**: Make improvements based on feedback

This tracking document will be updated regularly as the migration progresses.
