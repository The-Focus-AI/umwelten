# Jeeves Bot – copy to .env and edit
# From this directory: cp env.example .env

# Main work folder for the bot. Contains agent config, memories, facts, journal,
# cloned agent repos (repos/), skills cache, and tools.
# Default if unset: ~/.jeeves (recommended — keeps data outside the repo)
# Use an absolute path, or a path relative to the current working directory.
# NOTE: For dev, leave empty to use ~/.jeeves. Setting a relative path like
# ./jeeves-bot-data-dir puts repos/ inside the umwelten repo, which is usually
# not what you want (clutters git, duplicates skill repos alongside agent repos).
JEEVES_WORK_DIR=

# Sessions directory for storing all interactions, media files, and downloaded content.
# Each session gets its own subdirectory. Media from Telegram, large downloads from wget/markify go here.
# Default if unset: ~/.jeeves-sessions (recommended — keeps data outside the repo)
# Use an absolute path, or a path relative to the current working directory.
JEEVES_SESSIONS_DIR=

# Optional: Override the config file path (agents and metadata).
# If set, this file is used instead of <JEEVES_WORK_DIR>/config.json
# JEEVES_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/config.json

# Telegram (required for the Telegram runner)

# Model (optional; defaults: google, gemini-3-flash-preview)

# Provider API keys (required for the chosen provider)

# For OpenRouter:
# OPENROUTER_API_KEY=

# Tavily (optional; for web search tool)
# TAVILY_API_KEY=

# Markify (optional). If set, the markify tool uses this service instead of built-in conversion. Default: built-in.
