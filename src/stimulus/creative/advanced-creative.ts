Dr. Sarah Chen stared at the temporal displacement device, her hands trembling. The message had arrived exactly as predicted: "Don't go back. The past is not what you think."

But she had to know. Her brother's death in 2023 didn't make sense. The police called it an accident, but the physics were impossible.

She activated the device.

The world dissolved around her, and she found herself standing in her brother's apartment, exactly one hour before his death. But something was wrong. The apartment was empty, spotless, as if no one had lived there for months.

A note on the table read: "Sarah, if you're reading this, you've made the same mistake I did. The past isn't fixed. It's fluid. And it's fighting back."

The walls began to shimmer. The apartment was dissolving, reality itself unraveling around her. She had broken the fundamental rule of time travel: never go back to change what you don't understand.

As the world collapsed around her, Sarah realized the truth. Her brother hadn't died in an accident. He had been erased from time itself, and now she was about to join him.`

The waves that crash upon the shore at night
Sing lullabies to those who dare to dream,
Their rhythm soft, their voices full of light,
Like whispers in a never-ending stream.

The moon above reflects upon the deep,
A silver path that leads to distant lands,
Where mermaids dance and ancient secrets keep,
And time itself is held in gentle hands.

The ocean calls to all who seek its peace,
Its vastness holds both mystery and truth,
A place where all our earthly troubles cease,
And we can find the wisdom of our youth.

So listen to the ocean's gentle song,
And let its waves carry you along.`

SARAH (30s, nervous, fidgeting with her coffee cup) sits at a small table by the window. She checks her phone for the third time in two minutes.

The door opens. ALEX (30s, confident, carrying a laptop bag) enters, scanning the room. Their eyes meet. Sarah waves hesitantly.

ALEX approaches the table.

ALEX
Sarah?

SARAH
(standing up, almost knocking over her coffee)
Yes! Hi, Alex. I'm so glad you could make it.

ALEX
(smiling, setting down the laptop bag)
Of course. I've been looking forward to this.

They both sit. An awkward pause.

SARAH
So... this is weird, right? Meeting someone from the internet?

ALEX
(laughing)
Only if we make it weird. I think it's kind of exciting.

Sarah relaxes slightly, a genuine smile appearing.

SARAH
You know what? I think you're right.`

I decided to cook dinner for my date. How hard could it be? I'd seen cooking shows. I had a recipe. I had confidence.

The recipe said "heat oil in a pan." I heated the oil. Then I heated it some more. Then I wondered why the smoke detector was going off.

The recipe said "add onions and saut√© until golden." I added onions. They turned black. I added more onions. They also turned black. I was starting to think the recipe was wrong.

The recipe said "season to taste." I seasoned. I tasted. I ran to the sink. I had created something that tasted like regret and broken dreams.

My date arrived to find me standing in a kitchen that looked like a crime scene, holding a spoon and looking defeated.

"Did you... cook?" she asked, eyeing the charred remains of what might have been vegetables.

"I tried," I said. "I really tried."

She smiled and picked up the phone. "Pizza it is, then."

And that's how I learned that some people are meant to cook, and some people are meant to order takeout and pretend they're sophisticated.`
