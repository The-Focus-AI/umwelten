## What's Searchable

The search indexes:

## Search Result Categories

Search results are organized by:

| Installation instructions | "getting started" |
| API documentation | "TypeScript API" |
| Model evaluation | "eval run" |
| Provider setup | "OpenRouter setup" |

## Search Analytics

The search system tracks usage to improve relevance and help identify popular search terms. This helps us:

## Troubleshooting Search

### No Results Found

If you're not finding what you're looking for:

1. **Try different terms**: Use synonyms or related terms
2. **Check spelling**: Ensure search terms are spelled correctly
3. **Use broader terms**: Start with general terms, then refine
4. **Check the navigation**: Use the sidebar navigation as an alternative

### Search Not Working
