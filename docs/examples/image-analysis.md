# Basic Image Analysis

This example shows how to analyze images using Umwelten's vision-capable models. This corresponds to the migrated `image-parsing.ts` script functionality.

## Simple Image Analysis

### Basic Image Description

Analyze a single image across multiple vision models:

```bash
umwelten eval run \
  --prompt "Analyze this image and provide a summary of the content." \
  --models "google:gemini-2.0-flash,ollama:qwen2.5vl:latest,ollama:gemma3:12b" \
  --id "image-analysis" \
  --attach "./input/images/test-image.jpg" \
  --concurrent
```

### Detailed Analysis with Specific Questions

Ask specific questions about image content:

```bash
umwelten eval run \
  --prompt "What objects do you see in this image? Describe the colors, lighting, and overall mood." \
  --models "google:gemini-2.0-flash,ollama:qwen2.5vl:latest" \
  --id "detailed-image-analysis" \
  --attach "./path/to/image.png"
```

### Text Recognition in Images

Test OCR capabilities:

```bash
umwelten eval run \
  --prompt "Extract and transcribe any text visible in this image. If no text is present, describe what you see instead." \
  --models "google:gemini-2.0-flash,google:gemini-1.5-flash-8b" \
  --id "text-extraction" \
  --attach "./document-photo.jpg"
```

## Comparative Analysis

### Compare Vision Models

Test different vision models on the same image:

```bash
umwelten eval run \
  --prompt "Describe this image in detail, including objects, colors, composition, and any notable features." \
  --models "google:gemini-2.0-flash,google:gemini-1.5-flash-8b,ollama:qwen2.5vl:latest" \
  --id "vision-model-comparison" \
  --attach "./test-image.jpg" \
  --concurrent
```

### Generate Comprehensive Report

```bash
# Create detailed markdown report
umwelten eval report --id vision-model-comparison --format markdown

# Export HTML report with embedded images
umwelten eval report --id vision-model-comparison --format html --output vision-report.html
```

## Interactive Mode

### Real-time Image Analysis

Watch models analyze images in real-time:

```bash
umwelten eval run \
  --prompt "Provide a detailed artistic analysis of this image, including composition, color theory, and emotional impact." \
  --models "google:gemini-2.0-flash,ollama:qwen2.5vl:latest" \
  --id "artistic-analysis" \
  --attach "./artwork.jpg" \
  --ui
```

## Advanced Image Prompts

### Scene Understanding

```bash
umwelten eval run \
  --prompt "Analyze this scene: What's happening? Who are the people? What's the setting? What time of day might it be?" \
  --models "google:gemini-2.0-flash" \
  --id "scene-understanding" \
  --attach "./scene-photo.jpg"
```

### Technical Analysis

```bash
umwelten eval run \
  --prompt "Analyze this image from a photography perspective: lighting, composition, depth of field, and technical quality." \
  --models "google:gemini-2.0-flash,google:gemini-1.5-flash-8b" \
  --id "photo-technical-analysis" \
  --attach "./photograph.jpg" \
  --concurrent
```

### Safety and Content Analysis

```bash
umwelten eval run \
  --prompt "Analyze this image for content appropriateness and describe any safety concerns or notable elements." \
  --models "google:gemini-2.0-flash" \
  --id "content-safety-analysis" \
  --attach "./user-upload.jpg"
```

## Expected Output Examples

### Basic Image Analysis Results

**Google Gemini 2.0 Flash**
```
This image shows a bustling city street during what appears to be late afternoon. The scene includes:

- Multiple pedestrians walking on sidewalks
- Several cars and a bus in the street
- Tall buildings with glass facades reflecting sunlight
- Street lamps beginning to illuminate as daylight fades
- A few street vendors with small stalls
- Clear blue sky with some clouds visible between buildings

The lighting suggests golden hour photography, creating warm tones across the urban landscape. The composition captures the energy and movement of city life.
```

**Ollama qwen2.5vl:latest**
```
I can see an urban street scene with the following elements:

Objects visible:
- Cars (sedan, SUV, taxi)
- People walking
- Buildings (office buildings, storefronts)
- Traffic lights and street signs
- Trees lining the sidewalk

The image has warm lighting conditions, likely taken during late afternoon. The overall mood is busy and energetic, typical of a commercial district during rush hour. The perspective appears to be taken from street level, showing both the pedestrian and vehicular activity.
