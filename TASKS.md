# Umwelten Evaluation System - Task Tracker

## Project Overview
Building out the evaluation CLI system based on the promptfoo inspiration, following Option B (iterate on current success).

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Core CLI Commands
- [x] **Design eval command CLI interface and options**
  - Designed `umwelten eval run` with provider:model format
  - Simplified prompt-based approach vs complex case files
  
- [x] **Create src/evaluation/api.ts - thin API layer for CLI integration**
  - Built `runEvaluation()` function with config interface
  - Added model parsing and error handling
  - Integrated with existing FunctionEvaluationRunner
  
- [x] **Create src/cli/eval.ts - CLI command implementation**  
  - Complete CLI with all options (prompt, models, id, system, temperature, etc.)
  - Proper validation and error handling
  - Clean user feedback and progress reporting
  
- [x] **Add eval command to main CLI program**
  - Integrated into src/cli/cli.ts
  - Available as `umwelten eval run`
  
- [x] **Write tests for eval API and CLI following existing patterns**
  - 14 passing tests covering API functions
  - Mocked file system for reliable testing  
  - Error conditions and edge cases covered
  
- [x] **Test the eval run command with existing test case**
  - Verified working with multiple models
  - Tested resume functionality
  - Confirmed error handling

### Phase 2: Reporting & Analysis  
- [x] **Add eval report command to generate reports from existing results**
  - Built `generateReport()` function with multiple formats
  - Markdown, HTML, JSON, CSV output formats
  - Summary tables with timing, tokens, response lengths
  - Individual response details with metadata
  
- [x] **Write tests for eval report functionality**
  - Added 5 additional tests for report generation
  - Covered all output formats and error conditions
  - All 14 tests passing
  
- [x] **Consolidate README files and update documentation**
  - Removed README.cli.md and consolidated into main README
  - Added comprehensive eval command documentation  
  - Included examples and sample outputs
  - Updated Advanced Features and directory structure

### Phase 2 Continuation: Enhanced User Experience  
- [x] **Add eval list command to show available evaluations**
  - ‚úÖ List all evaluation IDs in output/evaluations/
  - ‚úÖ Optional --details flag to show comprehensive information  
  - ‚úÖ JSON output format for programmatic use
  - ‚úÖ Shows model counts, last modified dates, report availability
  - ‚úÖ Proper error handling for empty directories
  - ‚úÖ Helpful usage hints and next action suggestions

- [x] **Add progress indicators and better user feedback during evaluations**
  - ‚úÖ Interactive UI mode with `--ui` flag using Ink and React
  - ‚úÖ Live progress bars showing completion percentage
  - ‚úÖ Streaming response display as models generate content
  - ‚úÖ Real-time status indicators (pending, starting, streaming, completed, error)
  - ‚úÖ Individual timing for each model with elapsed time display
  - ‚úÖ Bordered response boxes with truncation for long content  
  - ‚úÖ Final completion summary with total time and success/failure counts
  - ‚úÖ Graceful Ctrl+C handling and app cleanup

## üöß Current Tasks

*No tasks currently in progress*

## üìã Planned Tasks

### Phase 2 Continuation: Enhanced User Experience
  
- [ ] **Add cost calculation integration to reports**
  - Integrate existing cost calculation system
  - Replace "N/A" cost estimates with real values
  - Add cost comparison columns in summary tables
  - Help users make cost-effective model choices

### Phase 2.5: Performance & Polish  
- [ ] **Implement concurrent evaluation support for faster processing**
  - Run multiple models in parallel with configurable concurrency
  - Add --concurrency flag to eval run command
  - Respect rate limits per provider
  - Significant speedup for multi-model evaluations
  
- [ ] **Enhance error handling and validation in eval run command**
  - Validate model availability before starting evaluation
  - Better timeout handling and retry logic
  - More informative error messages
  - Graceful recovery from transient failures

### Future Enhancements (Lower Priority)
- [ ] **Add eval diff command for comparing evaluations**
- [ ] **Add eval serve command for local dashboard**
- [ ] **Template system for common evaluation scenarios**
- [ ] **Integration with existing complex evaluation scripts**

## üéØ Success Metrics

### Phase 1: ‚úÖ Complete
- Working `umwelten eval run` command
- Comprehensive test coverage (14/14 passing)
- Full documentation and examples
- Maintains existing architecture patterns

### Phase 2: ‚úÖ Complete  
- Working `umwelten eval report` command
- Multiple output formats (Markdown, HTML, JSON, CSV)
- Consolidated documentation
- User-ready evaluation workflow

### Next Milestone Goals
- Discoverability: Users can easily find and work with evaluations
- Performance: Multi-model evaluations run efficiently  
- Cost transparency: Users understand the cost implications
- Polish: Smooth, professional user experience

## üìà Impact Assessment

**High Impact Delivered:**
- Promoted ad-hoc scripts to first-class CLI commands
- Made evaluation system discoverable and documented
- Provided actionable insights through comprehensive reports
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing systems

**Next High-Impact Opportunities:**
1. `eval list` - Essential discoverability (15 min effort, high utility)
2. Progress indicators - Significantly improves user experience
3. Cost integration - Leverages existing infrastructure for high user value
4. Concurrent processing - Major performance improvement

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

**Successful Patterns Established:**
- Simple prompt-based evaluations over complex case files
- Provider:model format for clear model specification
- Reuse of existing evaluation infrastructure  
- Comprehensive testing with mocked dependencies
- Multiple output formats for different use cases

**Key Design Principles:**
- Build on proven patterns from existing scripts
- Prioritize immediate usability over complex features
- Maintain clean separation between CLI and evaluation logic
